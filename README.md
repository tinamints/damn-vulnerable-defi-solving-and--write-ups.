# My DVDeFi Journey
**Goal:** Understand smart contract's vulnerability concepts and DeFi system by solving all challenges and writing writeups.

## writeups
i have writeups in 3 languages TH/JA/EN check them out!

## Progress
- 14/18 challenges solved
-  Current focus: ABI smuggling

## Key Lessons
- always be careful with what’s passed in calldata [from NaiveReceiver challenge]
- often times the vulnerability is in the calculation [from Compromised challenge]


## Learn with me
You can explore the codebase in the following order and read my code annotations to learn along with me.
> Annotations are marked with '>Note (tina):' or '//NOTE (tina):'.
### exploring order
1. The challenge's README.md
2. The challenge's test file
3. The challenge's main contract and helper contracts


## How i solve these challenges
1. look at the challenge's README.md to understand what is the objective and to get a rough idea of the challenge.
2. Check out the test file to get an even clearer idea of what is being tested, so we can write the solution under the conditions specified in the test file.
3. Review the main contract: quickly scan the entire contract then focus on high-risk areas(functions like flashloan, transfer or access control).
4. start by checking crucial points (conditions, input parameters, calculations). Take time on suspicious areas. make sure every bit of it make sense until we find where it doesn't.
5. code the solution in the test file and write code annotations.
